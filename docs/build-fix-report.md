# Build Fix Report

## Problem
The Next.js build was failing with the following error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '../styles/components/dashboard/index.css'
```

## Root Cause
The `src/app/globals.css` file was importing a non-existent CSS file:
- Line 9: `@import '../styles/components/dashboard/index.css';`

The `index.css` file didn't exist in the `src/styles/components/dashboard/` directory, although individual CSS files for each dashboard component were present.

## Solution
Created the missing `src/styles/components/dashboard/index.css` file that imports all the individual dashboard component CSS files:

```css
/* Dashboard Components CSS Imports */

/* Import individual dashboard component CSS files */
@import './assessment-table.css';
@import './chart-card.css';
@import './ocean-card.css';
@import './progress-card.css';
@import './stats-card.css';
@import './viais-card.css';
```

## Results
1. **Build Status**: ✅ Successful
   - The build now completes without errors
   - All pages are properly generated
   - Static and dynamic routes are working correctly

2. **Lint Status**: ✅ Successful with warnings
   - Linting completed successfully
   - Only warnings about using `<img>` instead of Next.js `<Image />` component
   - These are optimization suggestions, not blocking errors

## Next Steps (Optional)
To address the lint warnings and optimize the application further:
1. Replace `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image />` component in the following files:
   - `src/app/select-assessment/page.tsx` (6 instances)
   - `src/components/assessment/AssessmentHeader.tsx` (2 instances)
   - `src/components/dashboard/avatar.tsx` (1 instance)
   - `src/components/dashboard/stats-card.tsx` (1 instance)

2. Consider migrating from deprecated `next lint` to ESLint CLI as suggested in the output

## Files Modified
- Created: `src/styles/components/dashboard/index.css`
- Modified: None (only created the missing file)

## Verification Commands
- `pnpm build` - ✅ Passes
- `pnpm lint` - ✅ Passes (with warnings)
