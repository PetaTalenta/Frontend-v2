# AssessmentQuestionCard Fix Report

## Overview

This report documents the fix applied to `AssessmentQuestionCard.tsx` component to remove the dependency on the non-existent `AssessmentContext` and implement a proper flagging system integration with `AssessmentSidebar`.

## Problem Identified

After the assessment refactoring process documented in `assessment-refactor-report.md.md`, the `AssessmentContext` was removed from the project. However, the `AssessmentQuestionCard.tsx` component still had an import statement referencing this context:

```tsx
import { useAssessment } from "../../contexts/AssessmentContext";
```

Additionally, there was a disconnect between:
1. The flagging system in `AssessmentQuestionCard` (using local state)
2. The flagging display in `AssessmentSidebar` (using dummy data)

This caused:
1. The component to break since the `src/contexts` directory no longer exists
2. The flagging functionality to not work properly between components
3. Inconsistent flagging state across the assessment interface

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

1. **Created Shared Flagging System**
   - Created `src/hooks/useFlaggedQuestions.tsx` with a custom hook and context provider
   - Implemented centralized state management for flagged questions
   - Provided `toggleFlag`, `isFlagged`, `getFlaggedQuestions`, and `clearAllFlags` functions

2. **Updated AssessmentQuestionCard**
   - Removed the import statement for `useAssessment` from `AssessmentContext`
   - Replaced local state with `useFlaggedQuestions` hook
   - Simplified flagging logic using shared state

3. **Updated AssessmentSidebar**
   - Replaced dummy `getFlaggedQuestions()` function with the shared hook
   - Integrated with the centralized flagging system

4. **Updated AssessmentLayout**
   - Wrapped the entire assessment content with `FlaggedQuestionsProvider`
   - Ensured all child components have access to the shared flagging state

### Code Changes

#### Created: `src/hooks/useFlaggedQuestions.tsx`
```tsx
import { useState, createContext, useContext, ReactNode } from 'react';

// Context and provider implementation for shared flagged questions state
// Provides toggleFlag, isFlagged, getFlaggedQuestions, clearAllFlags functions
```

#### AssessmentQuestionCard Changes:
```tsx
// Before:
import { useAssessment } from "../../contexts/AssessmentContext";
const { toggleFlag, isFlagged } = useAssessment();

// After:
import { useFlaggedQuestions } from "../../hooks/useFlaggedQuestions";
const { toggleFlag, isFlagged } = useFlaggedQuestions();
```

#### AssessmentSidebar Changes:
```tsx
// Before:
const getFlaggedQuestions = () => {
  return [1, 5, 10]; // Dummy data
};

// After:
const { getFlaggedQuestions } = useFlaggedQuestions();
```

#### AssessmentLayout Changes:
```tsx
// Added provider wrapper:
<FlaggedQuestionsProvider>
  <AssessmentContent />
</FlaggedQuestionsProvider>
```

## Benefits

1. **Integrated Flagging System**: Flagging now works consistently between question cards and sidebar
2. **Centralized State Management**: Single source of truth for flagged questions
3. **Improved User Experience**: Users can see flagged questions in the sidebar when they flag them
4. **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns with dedicated hook for flagging functionality
5. **Reusable Solution**: The flagging system can be easily extended to other components if needed

## Testing

The flagging system should now work properly:
- Flagging a question in `AssessmentQuestionCard` updates the sidebar display
- Flagged questions persist across navigation within the assessment
- The flag count in the sidebar reflects the actual flagged questions
- Clicking on flagged questions in the sidebar details shows correct information

## Conclusion

The fix successfully resolves the import error and implements a proper integrated flagging system. The `AssessmentQuestionCard` and `AssessmentSidebar` now work together seamlessly, providing a consistent user experience for flagging and reviewing questions. This solution maintains the refactoring goals while restoring the intended functionality.
