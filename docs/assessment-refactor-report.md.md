# Assessment Refactor Report

## Overview

This report documents the refactoring process of assessment-related components to remove business logic and dependencies on external services while preserving the UI components.

## Scope

The refactoring focused on the following files and components:

### Pages

- `src/app/select-assessment/page.tsx`
- `src/app/assessment/page.tsx`
- `src/app/assessment-loading/page.tsx`

### Components

- `src/components/assessment/AssessmentLayout.tsx`
- `src/components/assessment/AssessmentSidebar.tsx`
- `src/components/assessment/AssessmentQuestionsList.tsx`
- `src/components/assessment/AssessmentLoadingPage.tsx`

## Changes Made

### 1. Pages Refactoring

#### select-assessment/page.tsx

**Changes:** Added dummy functions for navigation  
**Removed:** No business logic was present  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

#### assessment/page.tsx

**Changes:** None (already just rendering AssessmentLayout)  
**Removed:** No business logic was present  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

#### assessment-loading/page.tsx

**Changes:** Replaced complex API calls with simulated progress updates  
**Removed:** API service dependencies, WebSocket connections, real job monitoring  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### 2. Components Refactoring

#### AssessmentLayout.tsx

**Changes:** Replaced context dependencies with dummy state  
**Removed:** AssessmentContext, TokenWarning component  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

#### AssessmentSidebar.tsx

**Changes:** Added dummy functions for all missing dependencies  
**Removed:** AssessmentContext, assessment service imports, toast notifications  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

#### AssessmentQuestionsList.tsx

**Changes:** Replaced context with local state management  
**Removed:** AssessmentContext, AuthContext, validation functions  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

#### AssessmentLoadingPage.tsx

**Changes:** Simplified trivia system with dummy data  
**Removed:** Complex workflow state management  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Files Identified for Removal

Based on usage analysis, the following files are not referenced in the main dashboard and can be considered for removal:

- `src/components/assessment/FlaggedQuestionsPanel.tsx` - Not imported anywhere
- `src/components/assessment/AssessmentStatusMonitor.tsx` - Not imported anywhere
- `src/components/assessment/AssessmentQuestionCard.tsx` - Still used by AssessmentQuestionsList

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Removed

- `@/contexts/AssessmentContext`
- `@/contexts/AuthContext`
- `@/services/apiService`
- `@/services/assessmentService`
- `@/utils/assessment-calculations`
- `sonner` (toast notifications)

### State Management Changes

Replaced context-based state with local component state  
Added dummy data for demonstration purposes  
Simplified state flow to remove complex business logic

### API Integration Removal

Removed all external API calls  
Replaced with simulated responses  
Maintained UI components for potential future integration

## Benefits

- **Reduced Complexity:** Components are now self-contained with minimal dependencies
- **Improved Maintainability:** No complex business logic to maintain in UI components
- **Better Testability:** Components can be tested in isolation without mocking complex services
- **Performance:** No unnecessary API calls or complex state management overhead

## Future Considerations

- **Re-integration:** When backend services are ready, components can be easily re-integrated
- **State Management:** Consider implementing a proper state management solution if needed
- **API Layer:** Implement a proper API abstraction layer for future integrations

## Conclusion

The refactoring process successfully removed all business logic from assessment-related components while preserving their UI functionality. The components are now ready for integration with backend services when available, and can function independently for demonstration purposes.
