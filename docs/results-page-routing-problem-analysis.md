# Results Page Routing Problem Analysis

## Problem Summary

The issue occurs when navigating from the dashboard assessment table to the results page. Despite the API returning valid data for the assessment result, the results page displays "Hasil Assessment Tidak Ditemukan" (Assessment Result Not Found) error.

## Analysis of Network Requests

Based on the network logs provided, there are 3 requests being made:

1. **API Request (Successful)**:
   - URL: `https://api.futureguide.id/api/archive/results/f2aef3f3-21be-463b-a067-397dd9d15001`
   - Method: GET
   - Status: 304 Not Modified
   - Response: Complete and valid assessment result data

2. **CORS Preflight (Normal)**:
   - URL: `https://api.futureguide.id/api/archive/results/f2aef3f3-21be-463b-a067-397dd9d15001`
   - Method: OPTIONS
   - Status: 204 No Content
   - Response: Empty (normal for CORS preflight)

3. **Page Navigation (Successful)**:
   - URL: `http://localhost:3000/results/f2aef3f3-21be-463b-a067-397dd9d15001?jobId=7c3dacc2-9972-442b-8aa8-678d05c264bf&_rsc=1h1b5`
   - Method: GET
   - Status: 200 OK
   - Response: Next.js streaming data (normal)

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Hook Mismatch Issue

**Problem**: The results page (`src/app/results/[id]/page.tsx`) is using `useAssessmentData` hook, but this hook is just a re-export of `useAssessmentResult` from `src/hooks/useAssessmentResult.ts`.

**Evidence**:
- Line 5 in `src/app/results/[id]/page.tsx`: `import { useAssessmentData } from '../../../hooks/useAssessmentData';`
- Line 4 in `src/hooks/useAssessmentData.ts`: `export { useAssessmentResult as useAssessmentData } from './useAssessment';`

### 2. Data Structure Mismatch

**Problem**: The results page expects a different data structure than what the API provides.

**Evidence**:
- Lines 41-114 in `src/app/results/[id]/page.tsx` show manual data transformation
- The page is trying to access `result.persona_profile` (line 87) but the API response shows `test_result` contains the persona data
- The page is creating dummy data structures with fallback values

### 3. Error Handling Logic

**Problem**: The error condition on line 29 in `src/app/results/[id]/page.tsx` checks for `error || !result`, which means if the data transformation fails or returns null/undefined, it will show the error state even if the API call was successful.

**Evidence**:
- Line 29: `if (error || !result)`
- Line 32: `error={error || 'Assessment result not found'}`

### 4. Data Transformation Issues

**Problem**: The manual data transformation in the results page is not properly handling the API response structure.

**Evidence**:
- API response contains `test_result` with all the persona data
- The page is looking for `result.persona_profile` (line 87)
- The transformation logic is incomplete and may be returning null/undefined

## Possible Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Data Structure Mismatch (Recommended)

Update the results page to use the correct data structure from the API response:

1. Change `result.persona_profile` to `result.test_result` in line 87
2. Update the transformation logic to properly map API fields to component expectations
3. Remove the manual transformation and use the `transformedData` from the hook

### Solution 2: Use Proper Hook

Replace `useAssessmentData` with `useAssessmentResult` directly and use the `transformedData` property:

1. Import `useAssessmentResult` directly from `src/hooks/useAssessmentResult`
2. Use `transformedData` instead of manual transformation
3. Remove the manual transformation logic (lines 41-114)

### Solution 3: Fix Transformation Logic

Update the manual transformation to properly handle the API response structure:

1. Fix the property access patterns
2. Ensure all required fields are properly mapped
3. Add proper error handling for missing fields

## Most Likely Root Cause

The most likely root cause is the **data structure mismatch** between what the API returns (`test_result`) and what the page expects (`persona_profile`). This causes the transformation to fail, resulting in `!result` being true, which triggers the error state.

## Recommended Fix Priority

1. **High Priority**: Fix the data structure mismatch (Solution 1)
2. **Medium Priority**: Use the proper hook with transformedData (Solution 2)
3. **Low Priority**: Clean up the manual transformation logic (Solution 3)

## Implementation Notes

- The API is working correctly and returning valid data
- The routing is working correctly
- The issue is purely in the data handling layer
- The fix should be backward compatible with existing data
- Testing should include both new and existing assessment results
