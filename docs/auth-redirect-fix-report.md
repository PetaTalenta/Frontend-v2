# Auth Redirect Fix Report

## Problem
When running `pnpm run dev` and navigating to `localhost:3000`, users were being immediately redirected to the dashboard instead of going through the auth page first. This was happening due to token authentication logic that needed to be removed during refactoring.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `src/app/page.tsx` where the application was checking for a token cookie and redirecting to the dashboard if it existed:

```typescript
export default async function Page() {
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  const token = cookieStore.get('token')?.value;

  if (token) {
    redirect('/dashboard');
  }

  redirect('/auth');
}
```

## Solution Implemented
Removed all token-related authentication logic from the main page:

1. **Simplified the page component**: Removed cookie checking and token validation
2. **Direct redirect**: Now always redirects to `/auth` page regardless of any authentication state
3. **Cleaned up imports**: Removed the unused `cookies` import

### Changes Made

#### File: `src/app/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
import { Metadata } from 'next';
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

export default async function Page() {
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  const token = cookieStore.get('token')?.value;

  if (token) {
    redirect('/dashboard');
  }

  redirect('/auth');
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { Metadata } from 'next';
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

export default async function Page() {
  redirect('/auth');
}
```

## Impact
- ✅ Users will now always go to the auth page first when visiting the root URL
- ✅ Removed authentication token logic as requested for refactoring
- ✅ Simplified the codebase by removing unnecessary checks
- ✅ Maintained the redirect functionality but made it predictable

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. When users visit `localhost:3000`, they will always be redirected to `/auth`
2. No token or localStorage checks are performed at the root level
3. The authentication flow now starts from the auth page consistently

## Additional Notes
- The auth components (`Login.tsx`, `Register.tsx`, `AuthPage.tsx`) are already UI-only components with dummy authentication logic
- The `AuthGuard.tsx` component is also UI-only and doesn't contain any actual authentication logic
- localStorage references found in other files (like `ResultsPageClient.tsx`) are related to assessment data management, not authentication tokens
- No middleware files were found that could affect the routing behavior

This change aligns with the refactoring goal to remove all token/localStorage authentication logic while maintaining the UI functionality.
